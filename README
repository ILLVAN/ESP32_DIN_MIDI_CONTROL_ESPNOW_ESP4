# ESP32_DIN_MIDI_CONTROL_ESPNOW_ESP4
Using ESP32 boards to build a multinode MIDI controller with each node being responsible for a different task.

Communication between boards via ESPNOW.

ESP 1 - MIDI I/O: Arrange <br>
ESP 2 - Display and Inputs <br>
ESP 3 - MIDI I/O: TimeLine hidden features control: in sync looping, clock on/off etc. <br>
ESP 4 - Web Server <br> 
no ESPNOW yet, it's just a test sketch of randomnerdtutorials, thanks
